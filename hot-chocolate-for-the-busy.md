Hot Chocolate for the Busy
==========================

I used to think that the only way to heat milk properly for preparing hot chocolate was by using a saucepan. I eventually decided to experiment with a microwave oven. Here are the results.

What you'll need:

* a microwave oven
* two mugs
* milk
* your favorite hot chocolate powder -- I'm partial myself to Poulain's 1848 brand

Steps:

1. pour cold milk into one of the mugs, up to 3/4th capacity
1. heat in your microwave oven at maximum power for 2 mins (at 900W) -- it will boil, but not spill over
1. in the meantime, put two generous spoons of your chocolate powder in the other mug
1. add a little cold milk and stir vigorously -- it should become barely liquid (if in doubt, add a little more cold milk)
1. pour the hot milk in the mug containing the hot chocolate; no need to stir

Using mugs to prepare hot chocolate makes it a lot less messy compared to saucepans where the milk always seem to stick no matter how careful I am.
Mixing cold chocolate with hot milk tend to produce pleasant-looking swirls in the resulting drink.
Finally, mixing the powder with a little milk makes it a lot easier to mix with the rest of the milk.
